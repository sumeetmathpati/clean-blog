## Create / deleting DB

We use 
- `CREATE DATABASE databasename;` 
- `DROP DATABASE databasename;`		
- `ls`

commands to create and delete databases respectively. Both are **DDL** commands.

## Selecting database to use

Before starting to work on database, we have to choose it. We can so it by command,

```sql
use college;	-- 'college' is database name.
```

if you don't want to do this, everytime you work on a specific table, you have to mention table name, example,

```sql
select * from college.student;	-- 'student' is table in 'college' database.
```

## Create table tables

To create table in database, we use `CREATE TABLE` **(DDL)** statement.

Syntax is,

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
	column1 datatype,
	column2 datatype,
	column3 datatype,
	....
);
```
Examples,

```sql
CREATE TABLE faculty (	-- Create faculty table
	fid INT,
	fname VARCHAR(30),
	qualification varchar(30),
	did INT
);

CREATE TABLE student (	-- Create student table
	sid INT,
	sname VARCHAR(30),
	branch varchar(30),
	marks INT
);

CREATE TABLE department (	-- Create department table
	did INT,
	dname VARCHAR(30)
);
```

## Selecting data from table

The `SELECT` statement is one of the **DML** commands. It's used to select data from the table. On successfull execution of the `SELECT` command, we get result set back
